# PyMusic
Music Player built in python using pygame, tkinter. This Music player lists a mp3 files and on selection it plays them.

This Music player is currently under development coz it still has issues to deal with like the progress bar doesn't work for some reason, when current song finishes playing it does not play next song automatically, shuffle button shuffles the songs but stops the current song and plays random song.

if anyone can help me to deal with these issues and suggest anything, it will be appreciated.
next version of this code will be uploaded soon.
